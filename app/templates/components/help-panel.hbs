EXT. BRICK'S POOL - DAY

Steel, in the middle of a heated phone call:

STEEL
They're coming out of the woodwork!
(pause)
No, everybody we've put away!

<h3>Action</h3>

    Action, or scene description, is any paragraph that doesn't meet criteria for another element (e.g. Scene Heading, Character, Dialogue, etc.).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fountain respects your line-by-line decision to single or double-space, taking every carriage return as intentional.
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>
They drink long and well from the beers.

And then there's a long beat.
Longer than is funny.
Long enough to be depressing.

The men look at each other.</pre>

    <pre>
MOM (O. S.)
Luke! Come down for supper!

HANS (on the radio)
What was it you said?</pre>
  </li>

    You can force a Character element by preceding it with the "at" symbol <code>@</code>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Dialogue</h3>

  <li>
    Manual line breaks are allowed in Dialogue, as are intentionally "empty" lines--see the Line Breaks section.
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>
DAN
Then let's retire them. 
_Permanently_.
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Parenthetical</h3>
<ul class='list-unstyled'>

So much for retirement!</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dual Dialogue</h3>

    Dual, or simultaneous, dialogue is expressed by adding a caret ^ after the second Character element.
  </li>

BRICK
Screw retirement.

STEEL ^
Screw retirement.</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<ul class='list-unstyled'>
  <li>

</ul>

<h3>Emphasis</h3>
<ul class='list-unstyled'>
  <li>
    Fountain follows Markdown's rules for emphasis, except that it reserves the use of underscores for underlining, which is not interchangeable with italics in a screenplay.
  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>
*italics*
**bold**
***bold italics***
_underline_</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In this way the writer can mix and match and combine bold, italics and underlining, as screenwriters often do.

INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

This is the home of THE BOY BAND, AKA DAN and JACK[[Or did we think of actual names for these guys?]].  They too are drinking beer, and counting the take from their last smash-and-grab.  Money, drugs, and ridiculous props are strewn about the table.

[[It was supposed to be Vietnamese, right?]]

*Did you know Brick and Steel are retired?* </pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Boneyard</h3>
<ul class='list-unstyled'>

  </li>
  <li>
    <pre>
COGNITO
Everyone's coming after you mate!  Scorpio, The Boy Band, Sparrow, Point Blank Sniper...

As he rattles off the long list, Brick and Steel share a look.  This is going to be BAD.
